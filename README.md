# Symptoms Evaluation - Strategy Pattern - C#
Strategy Pattern C# implementation of an Hospital Symptoms Evaluation System

In this example, multiple strategies are defined for patient symptom evaluation by a Doctor. The HeartBurnStrategy defines a set of criteria and logic to assess symptoms associated with heartburn or indigestion. On the other hand, the HeartAttackStrategy defines a distinct set of criteria and logic to evaluate symptoms that could indicate a potential heart attack. By employing a range of strategies, the Doctor can accurately assess various health conditions based on the presented symptoms and provide appropriate medical care or recommendations.

In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.[1]
